#  Object Detection My Learning Journey

##  Overview
This repository documents my **end-to-end learning and experimentation in Object Detection**  from dataset preparation to model deployment.  
Iâ€™m using this space to explore how detection systems  work in real-world applications.

---

##  Goals
- Understand the **core concepts** behind object detection.  
- Learn how to **train, test, and evaluate** models using custom datasets.  
- Experiment with  different **models** . 
- Visualize and analyze **model outputs, bounding boxes, and performance metrics**.  
- Build a structured **pipeline** for dataset preparation, training, and inference.
